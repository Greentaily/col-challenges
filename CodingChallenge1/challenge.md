# Coding Challenge 1

Hello @everyone, another event coming your way :D
It's again coding challenge time! 3 questions worth 50 points each let's go

## Challenge 0:
The user will input the radius of a sphere, the function will return the volume of said sphere.

### Expected behaviour:

Please enter the sphere's radius: 5

Volume of a sphere with a radius of 5: 523.6




## Challenge 1:
The user will input a string, the function will return the character that occurred the most.

(Shouldn't be affected by lowercase or uppercase)

(If there's a tie between more than one character, they should all be displayed)

(Spaces are ignored)

### Expected behaviour:

Please enter a string: Hi how are you?

The character(s) that occurred the most: H, O




## Challenge 2:
I want you to make any of the following sorting algorithms: selection sort, insertion sort, or merge sort

(If you make more than one you don't get extra points lol)

(In the following example the user inputs the numbers, but you don't have to do it like that; you can make a randomizing function or a set input for example.)

### Expected behaviour:

Please enter the numbers to be sorted: 11 2 25 15 9

Result: 2 9 11 15 25

##

Just as before, you can solve any number of these in any language you want! When you're done with your code you should either:
1) Send it here with a spoiler tag
2) Send it to me in a DM

In both cases, please put in your message this tag: **#CodingChallenge1**

You have until Wednesday 25/11 to submit your entries.

Have fun coding!
